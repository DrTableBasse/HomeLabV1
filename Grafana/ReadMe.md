# How Grafana Works ?

Grafana is a tool that allows you to see metrics and logs on one panel. It's a tool that can be used to monitor the performance of your services and the resources they are using. It can be used to monitor the CPU, memory, disk, and network usage of your services. It can also be used to monitor the health of your services and to alert you if there are any issues with your services.

Basically, Grafana will just show informations that you send to it. You can use Prometheus, InfluxDB, or other tools to send metrics to Grafana. You can also use logs from your services to send them to Grafana.\
So there is a schema of how it works:
