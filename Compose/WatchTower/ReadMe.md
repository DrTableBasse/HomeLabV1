# Watchtower avec Docker Compose

## Introduction to Watchtower

Watchtower is a tool that automatically updates Docker containers when a new image is available. This is particularly useful for keeping your services up to date without manual intervention.

## Benefits of Watchtower

- **Automation**: Automatically updates Docker containers.
- **Security**: Ensures containers use the latest image versions, including security patches.
- **Simplicity**: Easy to configure and use with Docker Compose.

## Usage with Docker Compose

Here is an example `docker-compose.yml` file to use Watchtower:

```yaml
services:
    watchtower:
        image: containrrr/watchtower:latest
        container_name: watchtower
        environment:
            - PUID=1000
            - PGID=1000
            - TZ=Europe/Paris
            - WATCHTOWER_POLL_INTERVAL=604800
            - WATCHTOWER_CLEANUP=true
            - WATCHTOWER_INCLUDE_STOPPED=true
            - WATCHTOWER_REVIVE_STOPPED=false
            - WATCHTOWER_NOTIFICATIONS=shoutrrr
            - WATCHTOWER_NOTIFICATION_URL=discord://token@idWebhook #send notifications to discord
        volumes:
            - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
        network_mode: host
        restart: unless-stopped
```

## Configuration

- **WATCHTOWER_CLEANUP**: Removes old images after updating.
- **WATCHTOWER_POLL_INTERVAL**: Time interval (in seconds) between update checks.

## Starting

To start Watchtower with Docker Compose, use the following command:

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

This will launch Watchtower in the background and start monitoring container updates.
